Overview
The City of New York is embarking on a project to integrate payroll data across all its agencies. The City of New York would like to develop a Data Analytics platform to
accomplish two primary objectives:
• Financial Resource Allocation Analysis: Analyze how the City's financial resources are allocated and how much of the City's budget is being devoted to overtime.
• Transparency and Public Accessibility: Make the data available to the interested public to show how the City’s budget is being spent on salary and overtime pay for all
municipal employees.

This Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) has been built to support NYC payroll data, providing a robust and scalable architecture for data storage, integration, and analysis. The EDW schema and stored procedures help maintain data consistency and accuracy across various payroll datasets.

Business Requirements
• Dimensional model image of the Data warehouse
• Data Architecture image of the pipeline
• GitHub repository with source codes and a README
• PowerPoint presentation slides of the project for presentation to NYC stakeholders
